This module provides an introduction to the Arduino environment which is composed of three things: the Arduino board, the Arduino IDE, and the Arduino-compatible shields together with their libraries. We first investigate the board, discussing all of its main components, inputs, and outputs. We discuss how each component is used and we examine the board schematic to see how they are connected. We then discuss the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which is used primarily to write, compile, and upload code. We survey the interface of the IDE and discuss how to install and use it. We also examine the use of shields to extend the functionality of an Arduino-based system. We discuss how shield libraries provide a useful abstraction to facilitate programming.",Computer Science

Text data are unique in that they are usually generated directly by humans rather than a computer system or sensors, and are thus especially valuable for discovering knowledge about people’s opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text.

This course will cover search engine technologies, which play an important role in any data mining applications involving text data for two reasons. First, while the raw data may be large for any particular problem, it is often a relatively small subset of the data that are relevant, and a search engine is an essential tool for quickly discovering a small subset of relevant text data in a large text collection. Second, search engines are needed to help analysts interpret any patterns discovered in the data by allowing them to examine the relevant original text data to make sense of any discovered pattern. You will learn the basic concepts, principles, and the major techniques in text retrieval, which is the underlying science of search engines.","Orientation

These are just a few of the many intriguing questions we can ask about the social and technical networks that form integral parts of our daily lives. This course is about exploring the answers, using a language that anyone can understand. We will focus on fundamental principles like “sharing is hard”, “crowds are wise”, and “network of networks” that have guided the design and sustainability of today’s networks, and summarize the theories behind everything from the social connections we make on platforms like Facebook to the technology upon which these websites run.

Unlike other networking courses, the mathematics included here are no more complicated than adding and multiplying numbers. While mathematical details are necessary to fully specify the algorithms and systems we investigate, they are not required to understand the main ideas. We use illustrations, analogies, and anecdotes about networks as pedagogical tools in lieu of detailed equations.

Participants should complete Part A first -- Part B ""dives right in"" and refers often to material from Part A.]

This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.

This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.

The course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module of Part A. Part B assumes successful completion of Part A.

The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C. As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing. The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.

Week 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.","Introduction, Course-Wide Information, and Software Installation (Start Here)

Participants should complete Parts A and B first -- Part C ""dives right in"" and refers often to material from Part A and Part B.]

This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.

This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.

The course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module of Part A. Part B assumes successful completion of Part A.

The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C. As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing. The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.

Week 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.","Introduction, Course-Wide Information, and Software Installation (Start Here)

С её помощью можно решать невероятные задачи: оценивать состояние печени по кардиограмме, предсказывать зарплату по описанию вакансии, предлагать пользователю музыку на основании его анкеты в интернете.

Большими данными может оказаться что угодно: результаты научных экспериментов, логи банковских транзакций, метеорологические наблюдения, профили в социальных сетях — словом, всё, что может быть полезно проанализировать.
Самым перспективным подходом к анализу больших данных считается применение машинного обучения — набора методов, благодаря которым компьютер может находить в массивах изначально неизвестные взаимосвязи и закономерности.

На факультете компьютерных наук ВШЭ и в Школе анализа данных есть люди, активно использующие машинное обучение и разрабатывающие новые подходы к нему. Именно они — преподаватели этого курса.

В онлайн курсе вы изучите основные типы задач, решаемых с помощью машинного обучения — в основном речь пойдёт о классификации, регрессии и кластеризации. Узнаете об основных методах машинного обучения и их особенностях, научитесь оценивать качество моделей — и решать, подходит ли модель для решения конкретной задачи. Наконец, познакомитесь с современными библиотеками, в которых реализованы обсуждаемые модели и методы оценки их качества. Для работы мы будем использовать реальные данные из реальных задач.

You will see that estimating value functions can be cast as a supervised learning problem---function approximation---allowing you to build agents that carefully balance generalization and discrimination in order to maximize reward. We will begin this journey by investigating how our policy evaluation or prediction methods like Monte Carlo and TD can be extended to the function approximation setting. You will learn about feature construction techniques for RL, and representation learning via neural networks and backprop. We conclude this course with a deep-dive into policy gradient methods; a way to learn policies directly without learning a value function. In this course you will solve two continuous-state control tasks and investigate the benefits of policy gradient methods in a continuous-action environment.

Prerequisites: This course strongly builds on the fundamentals of Courses 1 and 2, and learners should have completed these before starting this course. Learners should also be comfortable with probabilities & expectations, basic linear algebra, basic calculus, Python 3.0 (at least 1 year), and implementing algorithms from pseudocode.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

-Understand how to use supervised learning approaches to approximate value functions
-Understand objectives for prediction (value estimation) under function approximation
-Implement TD with function approximation (state aggregation), on an environment with an infinite state space (continuous state space)
-Understand fixed basis and neural network approaches to feature construction
-Implement TD with neural network function approximation in a continuous state environment
-Understand new difficulties in exploration when moving to function approximation
-Contrast discounted problem formulations for control versus an average reward problem formulation
-Implement expected Sarsa and Q-learning with function approximation on a continuous state control task
-Understand objectives for directly estimating policies (policy gradient objectives)

We'll learn the basic components of Tensorflow and see how to use it to filter images.   Session 2: Training A Network W/ Tensorflow 
We'll see how neural networks work, how they are ""trained"", and see the basic components of training a neural network. We'll then build our first neural network and use it for a fun application of teaching a neural network how to paint an image.   Session 3: 
This session goes deep. We create deep neural networks capable of encoding a large dataset, and see how we can use this encoding to explore ""latent"" dimensions of a dataset or for generating entirely new content. We'll see what this means, how ""autoencoders"" can be built, and learn a lot of state-of-the-art extensions that make them incredibly powerful. We'll also learn about another type of model that performs discriminative learning and see how this can be used to predict labels of an image.   Session 4: 
This sessions works with state of the art networks and sees how to understand what ""representations"" they learn. We'll see how this process actually allows us to perform some really fun visualizations including ""Deep Dream"" which can produce infinite generative fractals, or ""Style Net"" which allows us to combine the content of one image and the style of another to produce widely different painterly aesthetics automatically.   Session 5: 
The last session offers a teaser into some of the future directions of generative modeling, including some state of the art models such as the ""generative adversarial network"", and its implementation within a ""variational autoencoder"", which allows for some of the best encodings and generative modeling of datasets that currently exist. We also see how to begin to model time, and give neural networks memory by creating ""recurrent neural networks"" and see how to use such networks to create entirely generative text.",Computer Science

Disclaimer: As you will notice, there is an abundance of small examples in this course, but at first sight there are not many industrial size systems being discussed. The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, it is not my intention to teach you performance analysis skills up to the level of what you will need in industry. Rather, I would like to teach you to think about modeling and performance analysis in general and abstract terms, because that is what you will need to do whenever you encounter any performance analysis problem in the future. After all, abstract thinking is the most revered skill required for any academic-level job in any engineering discipline, and if you are able to phrase your problems mathematically, it will become easier for you to spot mistakes, to communicate your ideas with others, and you have already made a big step towards actually solving the problem. Secondly, although dataflow techniques are applicable and being used in industry, the subclass of single-rate dataflow is too restrictive to be of practical use in large modeling examples. The analysis principles of other dataflow techniques, however, are all based on single-rate dataflow. So this course is a good primer for any more advanced course on the topic.

This course is part of the university course on Quantitative Evaluation of Embedded Systems (QEES) as given in the Embedded Systems master curriculum of the EIT-Digital university, and of the Dutch 3TU consortium consisting of TU/e (Eindhoven), TUD (Delft) and UT (Twente). The course material is exactly the same as the first three weeks of QEES, but the examination of QEES is at a slightly higher level of difficulty, which cannot (yet) be obtained in an online course.","Introduction
This course is part of a Blended Master Programme in Embedded Systems.
Modeling systems as token consumption/production systems
In this module/week you will learn to draw a model of a token consumption/production system, and communicate your interpretation of this model with others in an informal manner. At the end of this model, you will be able to draw your own models, and explain your interpretation of them in general terms. Also, you will know about the standard Petri-net interpretation of consumption/production systems, and will be able to point out particular patterns in Petri-net models. Finally, you will be able to refine a consumption/production model into a model that contains sufficient information to allow worst-case performance analysis. This is all tested using a peer-reviewed assignment.",Computer Science

Теперь создание устройств, которые взаимодействуют с физическим миром, доступно даже школьнику.

Наш курс состоит из серии практических задач про создание вещей, которые работают сами: изучают мир, принимают решения и действуют – двигаются, обмениваются данными друг с другом и с человеком, управляют другими устройствами. Мы покажем, как собирать эти устройства и программировать их, используя в качестве основы платформу Arduino.

Пройдя этот курс, вы сможете создавать устройства, которые считывают данные о внешнем мире с разнообразных датчиков, обрабатывают информацию, получают и отправляют данные на ПК, в Интернет, на мобильные устройства, управляют индикацией и движением. Создание устройств будет включать проектирование, изучение компонентов, сборку схем, написание программ, диагностику. Попутно с созданием самих устройств вы сделаете визуализацию на ПК, создадите веб-страницу, которую будет демонстрировать одно из ваших устройств, а также разберетесь с устройством и работой FDM 3D-принтера.

Помимо тех, кто увлекается робототехникой или стремится расширить кругозор и свои навыки, курс будет полезен всем, кто сталкивается с задачами бытовой и производственной автоматизации, а также занимается промышленным дизайном, рекламой и искусством.

Курс не требует специальных знаний у слушателей, доступен даже ученикам старших классов средней школы. Плюсом будут навыки программирования и владение английским языком на уровне чтения технической документации, однако обязательным это не является.

Весь курс посвящен практике и самым лучшим решением для вас будет раздобыть электронику, повторять показанные примеры и экспериментировать самостоятельно.

Significant interest in this area is explained by the great prospects that will open upon the implementation of its ideas, capturing almost all areas of human activity related to the transfer, storage and processing of information.
The purpose of this course is to show the basic ideas of quantum informatics, as well as the physical laws and basic mathematical principles. Much attention is paid to such phenomena as quantum entanglement, quantum parallelism, and quantum interference. It is these phenomena that underlie most of the known quantum protocols and algorithms, which are devoted to individual sections of this course. In particular, from the course, students will learn about quantum teleportation, quantum algorithms, quantum error correction and other topics related to the quantum computations theory.
As a result of the course, the students will be able to master the modern mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics used in quantum computations, master the ideas that underlie the most important quantum logic algorithms and protocols for transmitting and processing quantum information, and learn how to solve problems on these topics.

About
The course consists of six modules, which are arranged in two parts. The first part (Modules 1-2) focuses on the mathematical apparatus and the foundations of Quantum Mechanics. Physical laws and processes which underlay quantum computations are extensively described. In the second part of the course (Modules 3-6), we show how quantum computations, quantum logic algorithms and protocols of quantum information transfer could be implemented using the laws of quantum physics and phenomena discussed in the first part.
Module 1 focuses on the postulates of Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Information Theory. We introduce the important concept of a qubit and consider variants of its physical implementation. Certain statistical aspects of quantum theory are discussed. The concept of density matrix and separability, the notion of pure and mixed quantum states are introduced. In Module 2 we focus on the phenomenon of quantum entanglement and the mathematical description of entangled physical systems. We also describe an experiment aimed to test Bell inequalities and consider the well-known EPR paradox. In Module 3 we compare classical and quantum computations. Particularly, elementary logical elements (gates) and the simplest commutation schemes are described. The distinctive features of quantum computations are explained in Module 4. In particular, the No-Cloning theorem is proved, which forbids one to copy a qubit, quantum parallelism and superdense coding are discussed. We also describe in detail the protocol of quantum teleportation and give an example of its physical implementation. The well-known quantum logic algorithms are described in Module 5, these are Deutsch and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms, Quantum Fourier Transform and Shor’s algorithms for integer factorization. In Module 6 we discuss quantum and classical error correction theory: we highlight their differences and similarities, classify the possible error types and describe protocols of their correction.
The material is given in a form of short but informative videos with presentations and a detailed syllabus. At the end of every module, there are tests and control tasks according to the discussed topics. The tasks are organized in the form of problems and tests with multiple choice. Every module is supplemented with a literature list, which contains references on the mentioned researches and extra sources for self-study.

They give superpowers to many machine learning algorithms: handling missing data, extracting much more information from small datasets. Bayesian methods also allow us to estimate uncertainty in predictions, which is a desirable feature for fields like medicine.

When applied to deep learning, Bayesian methods allow you to compress your models a hundred folds, and automatically tune hyperparameters, saving your time and money.

In this online HSE course we will discuss the basics of Bayesian methods: from how to define a probabilistic model to how to make predictions from it. We will see how one can automate this workflow and how to speed it up using some advanced techniques.

We will also see applications of Bayesian methods to deep learning and how to generate new images with it. We will see how new drugs that cure severe diseases can be found with Bayesian methods.

Nació con el objetivo de disminuir el costo de los microcontroladores, que entonces los estudiantes empleaban para sus proyectos y que resultaban demasiado costosos.

Actualmente tiene diferentes usos, como la aplicación de desarrolladores de diseños artísticos e interactivos; de igual forma, muchas personas utilizan Arduino para incursionar en aplicaciones tecnológicas, como la automatización y la robótica.

Su aplicación, aunque pudiera parecer limitada a áreas de la ciencia muy especializadas, es en realidad común, al encontrarla en un cajero automático, un calentador de agua, la pluma de un estacionamiento o las puertas de una plaza o supermercado, y es que este tipo de herramientas, que facilitan nuestra vida diaria, están basadas en un pequeño microcontrolador, cuya tarea está dictada por un programa.

Programar es algo que hacemos día con día al planear nuestras actividades, pero si nos detenemos a organizar aquello que hacemos de manera inconsciente, obtendremos una serie ordenada de pasos que nos llevarán a un objetivo; si tenemos esto claro seremos capaces de planear actividades más complejas.

En este curso utilizaremos Arduino UNO para realizar dos prototipos que muestran el funcionamiento de dispositivos, como un chaleco para ciclista y un pastillero. No es requisito tener conocimientos de programación; sin embargo, conforme avances en el estudio de este curso probablemente necesites reforzar e investigar sobre algunos de los aspectos que aquí se expliquen.

It generates predictions for each individual customer, employee, voter, and suspect, and these predictions drive millions of business decisions more effectively, determining whom to call, mail, approve, test, diagnose, warn, investigate, incarcerate, set up on a date, or medicate.

But, to make this work, you've got to bridge what is a prevalent gap between business leadership and technical know-how. Launching machine learning is as much a management endeavor as a technical one. Its success relies on a very particular business leadership practice. This means that two different species must cooperate in harmony: the business leader and the quant.

This course will guide you to lead or participate in the end-to-end implementation of machine learning (aka predictive analytics). Unlike most machine learning courses, it prepares you to avoid the most common management mistake that derails machine learning projects: jumping straight into the number crunching before establishing and planning for a path to operational deployment.

Whether you'll participate on the business or tech side of a machine learning project, this course delivers essential, pertinent know-how. You'll learn the business-level fundamentals needed to ensure the core technology works within - and successfully produces value for - business operations. If you're more a quant than a business leader, you'll find this is a rare opportunity to ramp up on the business side, since technical ML trainings don't usually go there. But know this: The soft skills are often the hard ones.

After this course, you will be able to:

- Apply ML: Identify the opportunities where machine learning can improve marketing, sales, financial credit scoring, insurance, fraud detection, and much more.

NO HANDS-ON AND NO HEAVY MATH. Rather than a hands-on training, this course serves both business leaders and burgeoning data scientists alike by contextualizing the core technology, guiding you on the end-to-end process required to successfully deploy a predictive model so that it delivers a business impact. There are no exercises involving coding or the use of machine learning software.

WHO IT'S FOR. This concentrated entry-level program is for anyone who wishes to participate in the commercial deployment of machine learning, no matter whether you'll do so in the role of enterprise leader or quant. This includes business professionals and decision makers of all kinds, such as executives, directors, line of business managers, and consultants - as well as data scientists.

LIKE A UNIVERSITY COURSE. This course is also a good fit for college students, or for those planning for or currently enrolled in an MBA program. The breadth and depth of the overall three-course specialization is equivalent to one full-semester MBA or graduate-level course.

IN-DEPTH YET ACCESSIBLE. Brought to you by industry leader Eric Siegel - a winner of teaching awards when he was a professor at Columbia University - this curriculum stands out as one of the most thorough, engaging, and surprisingly accessible on the subject of machine learning.

VENDOR-NEUTRAL. This specialization includes illuminating software demos of machine learning in action using SAS products. However, the curriculum is vendor-neutral and universally-applicable.

Companies are seizing upon the power of this technology to combat risk, boost sales, cut costs, block fraud, streamline manufacturing, conquer spam, toughen crime fighting, and win elections.

Want to tap that potential? It's best to start with a holistic, business-oriented course on machine learning – no matter whether you’re more on the tech or the business side. After all, successfully deploying machine learning relies on savvy business leadership just as much as it relies on technical skill. And for that reason, data scientists aren't the only ones who need to learn the fundamentals. Executives, decision makers, and line of business managers must also ramp up on how machine learning works and how it delivers business value.

And the reverse is true as well: Techies need to look beyond the number crunching itself and become deeply familiar with the business demands of machine learning. This way, both sides speak the same language and can collaborate effectively.

This course will prepare you to participate in the deployment of machine learning – whether you'll do so in the role of enterprise leader or quant. In order to serve both types, this course goes further than typical machine learning courses, which cover only the technical foundations and core quantitative techniques. This curriculum uniquely integrates both sides – both the business and tech know-how – that are essential for deploying machine learning. It covers:

– How launching machine learning – aka predictive analytics – improves marketing, financial services, fraud detection, and many other business operations

– A concrete yet accessible guide to predictive modeling methods, delving most deeply into decision trees

– Reporting on the predictive performance of machine learning and the profit it generates

– What your data needs to look like before applying machine learning

– Avoiding the hype and false promises of “artificial intelligence”

– AI ethics: social justice concerns, such as when predictive models blatantly discriminate by protected class

NO HANDS-ON AND NO HEAVY MATH. This concentrated entry-level program is totally accessible to business leaders – and yet totally vital to data scientists who want to secure their business relevance. It's for anyone who wishes to participate in the commercial deployment of machine learning, no matter whether you'll play a role on the business side or the technical side. This includes business professionals and decision makers of all kinds, such as executives, directors, line of business managers, and consultants – as well as data scientists.

BUT TECHNICAL LEARNERS SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK. Before jumping straight into the hands-on, as quants are inclined to do, consider one thing: This curriculum provides complementary know-how that all great techies also need to master. It contextualizes the core technology, guiding you on the end-to-end process required to successfully deploy a predictive model so that it delivers a business impact.

We are entering in an era in which technology progress induces paradigm shifts in computing!
As a tradeoff between the two extreme characteristics of GPP and ASIC, we can find a new concept, a new idea of computing... the reconfigurable computing, which has combined the advantages of both the previous worlds. Within this context, we can say that reconfigurable computing will widely, pervasively, and gradually impact human lives. Hence, it is time that we focus on how reconfigurable computing and reconfigurable system design techniques are to be utilised for building applications.

One one hand reconfigurable computing can have better performance with respect to a software implementation but paying this in terms of time to implement. On the other hand a reconfigurable device can be used to design a system without requiring the same design time and complexity compared to a full custom solution but being beaten in terms of performance.
Within this context, the Xilinx SDx tools, including the SDAccel environment, the SDSoC environment, and Vivado HLS, provide an out-of-the-box experience for system programmers looking to partition elements of a software application to run in an FPGA-based hardware element, and having that hardware work seamlessly with the rest of the application running in a processor or embedded processor.

The out-of-the-box experience will provide interesting and, let us say, “good enough” results for many applications.
However, this may not be true for you, you may be looking for better performance, data throughput, reduced latency, or to reduce the resources usage... This course is focusing exactly on this. After introducing you to the FPGAs we are going to dig more into the details on how to use Xilinx SDAccel providing you also with working examples on how to optimize the hardware logic to obtain the best of of your hardware implementations. In this case, certain attributes, directives, or pragmas, can be used to direct the compilation and synthesis of the hardware kernel, or to optimise the function of the data mover operating between the processor and the hardware logic.
Furthermore, In this course we are going to focus on distributed, heterogeneous infrastructures, presenting how to bring your solutions to life by using the Amazon EC2 F1 instances.","Familizarize youself with FPGA technologies
From the mid-1980s, reconfigurable computing has become a popular field due to the FPGA technology progress. An FPGA is a semiconductor device containing programmable logic components and programmable interconnects but no instruction fetch at run time, that is, FPGAs do not have a program counter. In most FPGAs, the logic components can be programmed to duplicate the functionality of basic logic gates or functional Intellectual Properties (IPs). FPGAs also include memory elements composed of simple flip-flops or more complex blocks of memories. Hence, FPGA has made possible the dynamic execution and configuration of both hardware and software on a single chip. This module provides a detailed description of FPGA technologies starting from a general description down to the discussion on the low-level configuration details of these devices, to the bitstream composition and the description of the configuration registers.",Computer Science

The more general purpose you are, the more flexible you are and the more kinds of programs and algorithms you can execute on your underlying computing infrastructure. All of this is terrific, but there is no free food and this is happening, quite often, by losing in efficiency.

This course will present several scenarios where the workloads require more performance than can be obtained even by using the fastest CPUs. This scenario is turning cloud and data center architectures toward accelerated computing. Within this course, we are going to show you how to gain benefits by using Xilinx SDAccel to program Amazon EC2 F1 instances. We are going to do this through a working example of an algorithm used in computational biology.

The huge amount of data the algorithms need to process and their complexity raised the problem of increasing the amount of computational power needed to perform the computation. In this scenario, hardware accelerators revealed to be effective in achieving a speed-up in the computation while, at the same time, saving power consumption. Among the algorithms used in computational biology, the Smith-Waterman algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm, guaranteed to find the optimal local alignment between two strings that could be nucleotides or proteins. In the following classes, we present an analysis and successive FPGA-based hardware acceleration of the Smith-Waterman algorithm used to perform pairwise alignment of DNA sequences.

Within this context, this course is focusing on distributed, heterogeneous cloud infrastructures, providing you details on how to use Xilinx SDAccel, through working examples, to bring your solutions to life by using the Amazon EC2 F1 instances.","Reconfigurable cloud infrastructure
Distributed systems, data center and cloud architectures are facing the exponential growth in computing requirements and the impossibility for CPU-based solutions to keep pace. Within this context these complex distributed systems have to move toward accelerated computing. Accelerators complement CPU-based architectures and deliver both performance and power efficiency. Moreover, modern data center, as we know, can be used by several different users to serve different workloads and the idea of having an underlying architecture built on reconfigurable technologies seems to provide an ideal fit for these changing, demanding, workloads. This module provides a description of the main cloud computing components and technologies, as well as detailing the current technologies to accelerate cloud computing workloads.",Computer Science

The aim of the course is to raise awareness of ethical and societal aspects of AI and to stimulate reflection and discussion upon implications of the use of AI in society.

The course consists of four modules where each module represents about one week of part-time studies. A module includes a number of lectures and readings. Each lesson finishes with a mandatory assignment in which you write a short sum-up of the most important new knowledge/insight you gained from this lesson, and review a lesson sum-up written by another student/participant. The assessments are intended to encourage learning and to stimulate reflection on ethical and societal issues of the use of AI in society. Participating in forum discussions is voluntary but strongly encouraged.

In the first module, we will discuss algorithmic bias and surveillance. Is it really true that algorithms are purely logical and free from human biases or are they maybe just as biased as we are, and if they are, why is that and what can we do about it? AI in many ways makes surveillance more effective, but what does it mean to us if we are increasingly being watched in more and more sophisticated ways?

Next, we will talk about the impact of AI on democracy. We discuss why democracy is important, and how AI could hamper public democratic discussion, but also how it can help improve democracy. We will for instance talk about how social media could play in the hands of authoritarian regimes and present some ideas on how to make use of AI tools to develop the functioning of democracy.

A further ethical question concerns whether our treatment of AI could matter for the AIs themselves. Can artefacts be conscious? What do we even mean by “conscious”? What is the relationship between consciousness and intelligence? This is the topic of the third week of the course.

In the last module we will talk about responsibility and control. If an autonomous car hits an autonomous robot, who is responsible? And who is responsible to make sure AI is developed in a safe and democratic way?

The last question of the course, and maybe also the ultimate question for our species, is how to control machines that are more intelligent than we are. Our intelligence has given us a lot of power over the world we live in. Shall we really give that power away to machines and if we do, how do we stay in charge?

At the end of the course, you will have
· a basic understanding of the AI bias phenomenon and the role of AI in surveillance,
· a basic understanding of the importance of democracy in relation to AI and acquaintance with common issues with democracy in relation to AI,
· an understanding of the complexity of the concepts ‘intelligence’ and ‘consciousness’ and acquaintance with common approaches to creating artificial consciousness,
· a basic understanding of the concepts of ‘forward-looking’ and ‘backward-looking responsibility’ and an acquaintance with problems connected to applying these concepts on AI,
· a basic understanding of the control problem in AI and acquaintance with commonly discussed solutions to this problem,
· and an ability to discuss and reflect upon the ethical and societal aspects of these issues.","Algorithmic Bias and Surveillance

Although Robotic Process Automation (RPA) thrives in almost every industry and is growing fast, it works well only with structured data sources.
What about the data that’s not fully structured and comes in varying layouts? To address this problem, there is another aspect of RPA that is taking the industry by storm: cognitive automation.

While implementing RPA, you can deploy automations with “cognitive” capabilities. Cognitive automation uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to learn and understand the same way the human brain works. Thus, it assists humans in making decisions, completing tasks, or meeting goals. Using cognitive automation, you can extract semi—or unstructured data—which is 80% of all data!

Data is a precious asset. Businesses struggle to make sense of large volumes of available data and to generate a tangible value from them. Manual business processes barely contain any data that is available for capture. This is where Robotic Process Automation (or RPA) Analytics comes in. RPA bots don’t just automate business processes; they also digitize them. They take the large volume of data and interpret it in near real-time to provide actionable information.

In this course, you will be introduced to cognitive automation, the role that AI plays in it, and Automation Anywhere’s cognitive solution, IQ Bot. You will also be introduced to RPA analytics and explore how Automation Anywhere’s Web Control Room and Bot Insight can provide this functionality.

As you begin this course, you will learn the six steps to deploy cognitive automation. Next, you will explore the IQ Bot portal – Automation Anywhere’s web-based application for developing the cognitive IQ bots. You will then learn to use the portal by following the IQ Bot workflow.

Next, you will learn how RPA analytics help interpret and improve automated business processes. You will see how Bot Insight functions as an RPA analytics platform.

You will also explore the different types of RPA analytics and learn how to generate RPA analytics via two mechanisms – the Web Control Room for Operational Analytics and Bot Insight for Business Analytics and CoE Analytics.

Finally, you will learn how to use the RPA mobile app to study and edit the default CoE dashboard that is published via Bot Insight.","Understanding IQ Bot and Creating an Instance
In this module, you will explore the concept of cognitive automation, the six-step process of deploying a cognitive automation, IQ Bot as a cognitive solution, the basics of the IQ Bot portal, and the IQ bot workflow at a high-level. You will also learn to perform the first two steps of the IQ Bot workflow: Instance creation and Document analysis. After this, you will use the IQ Bot portal to create (and edit) a learning instance and trigger document analysis that produces document groups, depending on the input documents’ layout and content.",Computer Science

In our case study on analyzing sentiment, you will create models that predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...). In our second case study for this course, loan default prediction, you will tackle financial data, and predict when a loan is likely to be risky or safe for the bank. These tasks are an examples of classification, one of the most widely used areas of machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including ad targeting, spam detection, medical diagnosis and image classification.

In this course, you will create classifiers that provide state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks. You will become familiar with the most successful techniques, which are most widely used in practice, including logistic regression, decision trees and boosting. In addition, you will be able to design and implement the underlying algorithms that can learn these models at scale, using stochastic gradient ascent. You will implement these technique on real-world, large-scale machine learning tasks. You will also address significant tasks you will face in real-world applications of ML, including handling missing data and measuring precision and recall to evaluate a classifier. This course is hands-on, action-packed, and full of visualizations and illustrations of how these techniques will behave on real data. We've also included optional content in every module, covering advanced topics for those who want to go even deeper!

Learning Objectives: By the end of this course, you will be able to:
-Describe the input and output of a classification model.
-Tackle both binary and multiclass classification problems.
-Implement a logistic regression model for large-scale classification.
-Create a non-linear model using decision trees.
-Improve the performance of any model using boosting.
-Scale your methods with stochastic gradient ascent.
-Describe the underlying decision boundaries.
-Build a classification model to predict sentiment in a product review dataset.
-Analyze financial data to predict loan defaults.
-Use techniques for handling missing data.
-Evaluate your models using precision-recall metrics.
-Implement these techniques in Python (or in the language of your choice, though Python is highly recommended).","Welcome!
Classification is one of the most widely used techniques in machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including sentiment analysis, ad targeting, spam detection, risk assessment, medical diagnosis and image classification. The core goal of classification is to predict a category or class y from some inputs x. Through this course, you will become familiar with the fundamental models and algorithms used in classification, as well as a number of core machine learning concepts. Rather than covering all aspects of classification, you will focus on a few core techniques, which are widely used in the real-world to get state-of-the-art performance. By following our hands-on approach, you will implement your own algorithms on multiple real-world tasks, and deeply grasp the core techniques needed to be successful with these approaches in practice.

Many of the data structures and algorithms that work with introductory toy examples break when applications process real, large data sets. Efficiency is critical, but how do we achieve it, and how do we even measure it?

This is an intermediate Java course. We recommend this course to learners who have previous experience in software development or a background in computer science, and in particular, we recommend that you have taken the first course in this specialization (which also requires some previous experience with Java).

In this course, you will use and analyze data structures that are used in industry-level applications, such as linked lists, trees, and hashtables. You will explain how these data structures make programs more efficient and flexible. You will apply asymptotic Big-O analysis to describe the performance of algorithms and evaluate which strategy to use for efficient data retrieval, addition of new data, deletion of elements, and/or memory usage.

Software can’t be mined out of the ground, nor can software seeds be planted in spring to harvest by autumn. Software isn’t produced in factories on an assembly line. Software is a hand-made, often bespoke good. If a software developer is an artisan, then Unix is their workbench. Unix provides an essential and simple set of tools in a distraction-free environment. Even if you’re not a software developer learning Unix can open you up to new methods of thinking and novel ways to scale your ideas.

This course is intended for folks who are new to programming and new to Unix-like operating systems like macOS and Linux distributions like Ubuntu. Most of the technologies discussed in this course will be accessed via a command line interface. Command line interfaces can seem alien at first, so this course attempts to draw parallels between using the command line and actions that you would normally take while using your mouse and keyboard. You’ll also learn how to write little pieces of software in a programming language called Bash, which allows you to connect together the tools we’ll discuss. My hope is that by the end of this course you be able to use different Unix tools as if they’re interconnecting Lego bricks.","Unix and Command Line Basics

We start at the very beginning with a refresher on the “rise over run” formulation of a slope, before converting this to the formal definition of the gradient of a function. We then start to build up a set of tools for making calculus easier and faster. Next, we learn how to calculate vectors that point up hill on multidimensional surfaces and even put this into action using an interactive game. We take a look at how we can use calculus to build approximations to functions, as well as helping us to quantify how accurate we should expect those approximations to be. We also spend some time talking about where calculus comes up in the training of neural networks, before finally showing you how it is applied in linear regression models. This course is intended to offer an intuitive understanding of calculus, as well as the language necessary to look concepts up yourselves when you get stuck. Hopefully, without going into too much detail, you’ll still come away with the confidence to dive into some more focused machine learning courses in future.","What is calculus?
Understanding calculus is central to understanding machine learning! You can think of calculus as simply a set of tools for analysing the relationship between functions and their inputs. Often, in machine learning, we are trying to find the inputs which enable a function to best match the data. We start this module from the basics, by recalling what a function is and where we might encounter one. Following this, we talk about the how, when sketching a function on a graph, the slope describes the rate of change of the output with respect to an input. Using this visual intuition we next derive a robust mathematical definition of a derivative, which we then use to differentiate some interesting functions. Finally, by studying a few examples, we develop four handy time saving rules that enable us to speed up differentiation for many common scenarios.",Computer Science

This course will cover theories, including:
how to sort data and how it helps for searching;
how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively;
when it makes sense to proceed greedily;
how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies.
You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).","Module 1: Welcome
Here we will provide an overview of where algorithms and data structures are used (hint: everywhere) and walk you through a few sample programming challenges. The programming challenges represent an important (and often the most difficult!) part of this specialization because the only way to fully understand an algorithm is to implement it. Writing correct and efficient programs is hard; please don’t be surprised if they don’t work as you planned—our first programs did not work either! We will help you on your journey through the specialization by showing how to implement your first programming challenges. We will also introduce testing techniques that will help increase your chances of passing assignments on your first attempt. In case your program does not work as intended, we will show how to fix it, even if you don’t yet know which test your implementation is failing on.",Computer Science

You now know how to solve problems, write algorithms, and analyze solutions; and you have a wealth of tools (like data structures) at your disposal. You may now be ready for an internship or (possibly) an entry-level software engineering job. But can you land the internship/job? It depends in part on how well you can solve new technical problems and communicate during interviews. How can you get better at this? Practice!

With the support of Google’s recruiting and engineering teams we’ve provided tips, examples, and practice opportunities in this course that may help you with a number of tech companies. We’ll assist you to organize into teams to practice. Lastly, we’ll give you basic job search advice, and tips for succeeding once you’re on the job.","Welcome & What is a Software Engineering Interview?
Welcome to our course on effectively communicating your technical abilities. This course focuses on landing a technical job and excelling in a technical role. To succeed in job interviews, you’ll need to be able to confidently articulate your ability to solve challenging problems and come up with new solutions under potentially stressful conditions. After getting a technical job, the role of communication increases even more. You’ll need to work with other members of the team, communicate technical challenges and successes, and potentially sell the value of your work to those outside the company. Our goal is that by the end of this course each and every one of you understands the importance of technical communication, and has received constructive feedback on areas of potential improvement. In achieving this goal you will also learn about algorithmic thinking on the fly, how to evaluate a good interview answer to a difficult technical problem, and how “soft” skills impact interview outcomes. In this module, we’ll begin to see what a technical interview looks like, from the perspective of a major tech company. We’ll then focus on how to best get the interview in the first place. If you're not in the job market right now, you might want to skim the videos in this module and skip ahead to the Resume Critique (for insights about how to present yourself in writing) or the Introductions assignment (on effectively presenting yourself in person).",Computer Science

A reader is interested in a specific news article and you want to find similar articles to recommend. What is the right notion of similarity? Moreover, what if there are millions of other documents? Each time you want to a retrieve a new document, do you need to search through all other documents? How do you group similar documents together? How do you discover new, emerging topics that the documents cover?

In this third case study, finding similar documents, you will examine similarity-based algorithms for retrieval. In this course, you will also examine structured representations for describing the documents in the corpus, including clustering and mixed membership models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). You will implement expectation maximization (EM) to learn the document clusterings, and see how to scale the methods using MapReduce.

Learning Outcomes: By the end of this course, you will be able to:
-Create a document retrieval system using k-nearest neighbors.
-Identify various similarity metrics for text data.
-Reduce computations in k-nearest neighbor search by using KD-trees.
-Produce approximate nearest neighbors using locality sensitive hashing.
-Compare and contrast supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.
-Cluster documents by topic using k-means.
-Describe how to parallelize k-means using MapReduce.
-Examine probabilistic clustering approaches using mixtures models.
-Fit a mixture of Gaussian model using expectation maximization (EM).

The objective of the course is to provide an exposition first to the notion of computability, then to the notion of computational feasibility or tractability. We first convince ourselves that for our purpose it suffices to consider only language recognition problems instead of general computational problems. We then provide a thorough account of finite-state automata and regular languages, not only because these capture the simplest language class of interest and are useful in many diverse domains. We then consider context grammars and languages, and their properties. Next, we consider Turing machines (TMs). We then obtain the separation of the classes recursively enumerable, and recursive. A number of TM-related problems are shown to be undecidable. Finally, we introduce the notion of feasible or tractable computation.","Mod-01 Lec-01 What is theory of computation?.

How does an internet router forward packets of network traffic to minimize delay? How does an aid group allocate resources to its affiliated local partners?

To solve such problems, we first represent the key pieces of data in a complex data structure. In this course, you’ll learn about data structures, like graphs, that are fundamental for working with structured real world data. You will develop, implement, and analyze algorithms for working with this data to solve real world problems. In addition, as the programs you develop in this course become more complex, we’ll examine what makes for good code and class hierarchy design so that you can not only write correct code, but also share it with other people and maintain it in the future.

The backbone project in this course will be a route planning application. You will apply the concepts from each Module directly to building an application that allows an autonomous agent (or a human driver!) to navigate its environment. And as usual we have our different video series to help tie the content back to its importance in the real world and to provide tiered levels of support to meet your personal needs.","Introduction to the Course
Welcome to the first week in the third course of our Intermediate Java Programming Specialization. Once again start with introductions, and in particular introduce the unique structure of this course. Also, if you're not sure if this course is right for you, we've got an optional pre-course quiz coming right up that can help you figure out if you're in the right place. If you decide to stay with us (and we really hope you will!) we've got a great backbone project for you: your very own mapping application, inspired by Google Maps! The core data structure throughout this course is graphs, which may very well be the most fundamental data structure in all of computer science. Ready to begin? So are we!",Computer Science

COURSE OUTLINE: Soft computing is an emerging approach to computing which parallel the remarkable ability of the human mind to reason and learn in an environment of uncertainty and imprecision. Soft computing is based on some biological inspired methodologies such as genetics, evolution, ant’s behaviors, particles swarming, human nervous systems, etc. Now, soft computing is the only solution when we don’t have any mathematical modeling of problem solving (i.e., algorithm), need a solution to a complex problem in real time, easy to adapt with changed scenario and can be implemented with parallel computing. It has enormous applications in many application areas such as medical diagnosis, computer vision, hand written character recondition, pattern recognition, machine intelligence, weather forecasting, network optimization, VLSI design, etc.","Lecture 1 Introduction to soft computing.

The training is role-based and uses case scenarios. No additional hardware or software are required for this course.

Our nation’s healthcare system is changing at a rapid pace. Transformative health care delivery programs depend heavily on health information technology to improve and coordinate care, maintain patient registries, support patient engagement, develop and sustain data infrastructure necessary for multi-payer value-based payment, and enable analytical capacities to inform decision making and streamline reporting. The accelerated pace of change from new and expanding technology will continue to be a challenge for preparing a skilled workforce so taking this training will help you to stay current in the dynamic landscape of health care.

This course is one of three related courses in the HI-FIVE training program, which has topics on population health, care coordination and interoperability, value-based care, healthcare data analytics, and patient-centered care. Each of the three courses is designed from a different perspective based on various healthcare roles. This third course is from an administrative or IT perspective, geared towards executives, managers, analysts, and staff that work in administration, business, finance, operations, data or IT. However, we encourage anyone working in healthcare, health IT, public health, and population health to participate in any of the three trainings.","Course and Case Introduction

567,Deep Learning for Visual Computing,NPTEL,YouTube,Deep Learning For Visual Computing - IITKGP,Free Online Course,,,11 hours worth of material,English,,"Deep learning is a genre of machine learning algorithms that attempt to solve tasks by learning abstraction in data following a stratified description paradigm using non-­linear transformation architectures. When put in simple terms, say you want to make the machine recognize Mr. X standing in front of Mt. E on an image; this task is a stratified or hierarchical recognition task. At the base of the recognition, the pyramid would be features that can discriminate flats, lines, curves, sharp angles, color; higher up will be kernels which use this information to discriminate body parts, trees, natural scenery, clouds, etc.; higher up it will use this knowledge to recognize humans, animals, mountains, etc.; and higher up it will learn to recognize Mr. X and Mt. E and finally the apex lexical synthesizer module would say that Mr. X is standing in front of Mt. E. Deep learning is all about how you make machines synthesize this hierarchical logic and also learn these representative features and kernels all by itself. It has been used to solve problems like handwritten character recognition, object and product recognition, and localization, image captioning, generating synthetic images for self-driving cars. This course would provide you insights into the theory and coding practice of deep learning for visual computing through curated exercises with Python and PyTorch on current developments.","Deep Learning for Visual Computing (NPTEL Online Course) - Dr. Debdoot Sheet (IIT Kharagpur).

576,Introduction to Blockchain Technology and Application,NPTEL,YouTube,IIT Kanpur July 2018,Free Online Course,,,19 hours worth of material,English,,"Blockchain is an emerging technology platform for developing decentralized applications and data storage, over and beyond its role as the technology underlying the cryptocurrencies. The basic tenet of this platform is that it allows one to create a distributed and replicated ledger of events, transactions, and data generated through various IT processes with strong cryptographic guarantees of tamper resistance, immutability, and verifiability. Public blockchain platforms allow us to guarantee these properties with overwhelming probabilities even when untrusted users are participants of distributed applications with ability to transact on the platform. Even though, blockchain technology has become popularly known because of its use in the implementation of Cryptocurrencies such as BitCoin, Ethereum, etc., the technology itself holds much more promise in various areas such as time stamping, logging of critical events in a system, recording of transactions, trustworthy e-governance etc. Many researchers are working on many such use cases such as decentralized public key infrastructure, self-sovereign identity management, registry maintenance, health record management, decentralized authentication, decentralized DNS, etc. Also, corporations such as IBM and Microsoft are developing their own applications in diverse fields such as the Internet of Things (IoT), etc., even enabling blockchain platforms on the cloud. Considering the need to disseminate the emerging concepts for students, we decided to prepare a new course on blockchain technology platforms and applications.","Introduction to Blockchain Technology and Applications, Prof. Sandeep Shukla.

By the end of this project, you will be able to use the LIME and H2O packages in R for automatic and interpretable machine learning, build classification models quickly with H2O AutoML and explain and interpret model predictions using LIME.

Machine learning (ML) models such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Machines, Neural Networks, Stacked Ensembles, etc., are often considered black boxes. However, they are more accurate for predicting non-linear phenomena due to their flexibility. Experts agree that higher accuracy often comes at the price of interpretability, which is critical to business adoption, trust, regulatory oversight (e.g., GDPR, Right to Explanation, etc.). As more industries from healthcare to banking are adopting ML models, their predictions are being used to justify the cost of healthcare and for loan approvals or denials. For regulated industries that use machine learning, interpretability is a requirement. As Finale Doshi-Velez and Been Kim put it, interpretability is ""The ability to explain or to present in understandable terms to a human."".

To successfully complete the project, we recommend that you have prior experience with programming in R, basic machine learning theory, and have trained ML models in R.

This allows for file management even when no GUI tools are present, which is common in a server environment. For example, in an organization it is important for new users to share a common directory and file setup to improve productivity. A system admin can add the new user and create the directory structure common to all other users in the system. The user can then customize their Linux experience by adding their own files and directories.

Often these stories may be lies and propaganda that is deliberately intended to confuse the viewer, or may be characterized as ""click-bait"" written for monetary incentives (the writer profits on the number of people who click on the story). In recent years, fake news stories have proliferated via social media, partially because they are so readily and widely spread online. Worse yet, Artificial Intelligence and natural language processing, or NLP, technology is ushering in an era of artificially-generated fake news. Both types of fake news are detectable with the use of NLP and deep learning.

Imaging has a long history, spanning several centuries. But the advances made in the last three decades have revolutionized the camera and dramatically improved the robustness and accuracy of computer vision systems. We describe the fundamentals of imaging, as well as recent innovations in imaging that have had a profound impact on computer vision.

This course starts with examining how an image is formed using a lens camera. We explore the optical characteristics of a camera such as its magnification, F-number, depth of field and field of view. Next, we describe how solid-state image sensors (CCD and CMOS) record images, and the key properties of an image sensor such as its resolution, noise characteristics and dynamic range. We describe how image sensors can be used to sense color as well as capture images with high dynamic range. In certain structured environments, an image can be thresholded to produce a binary image from which various geometric properties of objects can be computed and used for recognizing and locating objects. Finally, we present the fundamentals of image processing – the development of computational tools to process a captured image to make it cleaner (denoising, deblurring, etc.) and easier for computer vision systems to analyze (linear and non-linear image filtering methods).","Getting Started: Camera and Imaging

In particular, we are interested in the 3D reconstruction of a rigid scene from images taken by a stationary camera (same viewpoint). This problem is interesting as we want the multiple images of the scene to capture complementary information despite the fact that the scene is rigid and the camera is fixed. To this end, we explore several ways of capturing images where each image provides additional information about the scene.

In order to estimate scene properties (depth, surface orientation, material properties, etc.) we first define several important radiometric concepts, such as, light source intensity, surface illumination, surface brightness, image brightness and surface reflectance. Then, we tackle the challenging problem of shape from shading - recovering the shape of a surface from its shading in a single image. Next, we show that if multiple images of a scene of known reflectance are taken while changing the illumination direction, the surface normal at each scene point can be computed. This method, called photometric stereo, provides a dense surface normal map that can be integrated to obtain surface shape.

Next, we discuss depth from defocus, which uses the limited depth of field of the camera to estimate scene structure. From a small number of images taken by changing the focus setting of the lens, a dense depth of the scene is recovered. Finally, we present a suite of techniques that use active illumination (the projection of light patterns onto the scene) to get precise 3D reconstructions of the scene. These active illumination methods are the workhorse of factory automation. They are used on manufacturing lines to assemble products and inspect their visual quality. They are also extensively used in other domains such as driverless cars, robotics, surveillance, medical imaging and special effects in movies.","Getting Started: 3D Reconstruction - Single Viewpoint

Feature and boundary detection is a critical preprocessing step for a variety of vision tasks including object detection, object recognition and metrology – the measurement of the physical dimensions and other properties of objects. The course presents a variety of methods for detecting features and boundaries and shows how features extracted from an image can be used to solve important vision tasks.

We begin with the detection of simple but important features such as edges and corners. We show that such features can be reliably detected using operators that are based on the first and second derivatives of images. Next, we explore the concept of an “interest point” – a unique and hence useful local appearance in an image. We describe how interest points can be robustly detected using the SIFT detector. Using this detector, we describe an end-to-end solution to the problem of stitching overlapping images of a scene to obtain a wide-angle panorama. Finally, we describe the important problem of finding faces in images and show several applications of face detection.","Getting Started: Features and Boundaries

We start by first building a comprehensive geometric model of a camera and then develop a method for finding (calibrating) the internal and external parameters of the camera model. Then, we show how two such calibrated cameras, whose relative positions and orientations are known, can be used to recover the 3D structure of the scene. This is what we refer to as simple binocular stereo. Next, we tackle the problem of uncalibrated stereo where the relative positions and orientations of the two cameras are unknown. Interestingly, just from the two images taken by the cameras, we can both determine the relative positions and orientations of the cameras and then use this information to estimate the 3D structure of the scene.

Next, we focus on the problem of dynamic scenes. Given two images of a scene that includes moving objects, we show how the motion of each point in the image can be computed. This apparent motion of points in the image is called optical flow. Optical flow estimation allows us to track scene points over a video sequence. Next, we consider the video of a scene shot using a moving camera, where the motion of the camera is unknown. We present structure from motion that takes as input tracked features in such a video and determines not only the 3D structure of the scene but also how the camera moves with respect to the scene. The methods we develop in the course are widely used in object modeling, 3D site modeling, robotics, autonomous navigation, virtual reality and augmented reality.","Getting Started: 3D Reconstruction - Multiple Viewpoints

This course focuses on the all-important problem of perception.

We first describe the problem of tracking objects in complex scenes. We look at two key challenges in this context. The first is the separation of an image into object and background using a technique called change detection. The second is the tracking of one or more objects in a video. Next, we examine the problem of segmenting an image into meaningful regions. In particular, we take a bottom-up approach where pixels with similar attributes are grouped together to obtain a region.

Finally, we tackle the problem of object recognition. We describe two approaches to the problem. The first directly recognize an object and its pose using the appearance of the object. This method is based on the concept of dimension reduction, which is achieved using principal component analysis. The second approach is to use a neural network to solve the recognition problem as one of learning a mapping from the input (image) to the output (object class, object identity, activity, etc.). We describe how a neural network is constructed and how it is trained using the backpropagation algorithm.",,Computer Science

It covers the second half of our book Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach (the first half is covered in our Coursera course Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose, to be released in the fall of 2018). Our intent is to demystify computation and to build awareness about the substantial intellectual underpinnings and rich history of the field of computer science.

First, we introduce classic algorithms along with scientific techniques for evaluating performance, in the context of modern applications. Next, we introduce classic theoretical models that allow us to address fundamental questions about computation, such as computability, universality, and intractability. We conclude with machine architecture (including machine-language programming and its relationship to coding in Java) and logic design (including a full CPU design built from the ground up).

The course emphasizes the relationships between applications programming, the theory of computation, real computers, and the field's history and evolution, including the nature of the contributions of Boole, Shannon, Turing, von Neumann, and others.

Given that DeFi is only a few years old there are plenty of risks. The course begins with the most obvious risk: smart contract risk. Smart contracts are foundational for DeFi. The code of these contracts is public - opening a clear attack vector for hackers. That is, in traditional finance, hackers need to break into a system to get access to the code and data. In DeFi, everything is open source.There are many other risks studied including: Governance risk; Oracle risk; Scaling risk; Decentralized Exchange or DEX risk; Custodial risk; Environmental risk; and Regulatory risk.","Smart Contract Risk

At the end of this course, you'll be familiar with important mathematical concepts and you can implement PCA all by yourself. If you’re struggling, you'll find a set of jupyter notebooks that will allow you to explore properties of the techniques and walk you through what you need to do to get on track. If you are already an expert, this course may refresh some of your knowledge.

The lectures, examples and exercises require:
1. Some ability of abstract thinking
2. Good background in linear algebra (e.g., matrix and vector algebra, linear independence, basis)
3. Basic background in multivariate calculus (e.g., partial derivatives, basic optimization)
4. Basic knowledge in python programming and numpy

Disclaimer: This course is substantially more abstract and requires more programming than the other two courses of the specialization. However, this type of abstract thinking, algebraic manipulation and programming is necessary if you want to understand and develop machine learning algorithms.","Statistics of Datasets
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most important dimensionality reduction algorithms in machine learning. In this course, we lay the mathematical foundations to derive and understand PCA from a geometric point of view. In this module, we learn how to summarize datasets (e.g., images) using basic statistics, such as the mean and the variance. We also look at properties of the mean and the variance when we shift or scale the original data set. We will provide mathematical intuition as well as the skills to derive the results. We will also implement our results in code (jupyter notebooks), which will allow us to practice our mathematical understand to compute averages of image data sets. Therefore, some python/numpy background will be necessary to get through this course.

Note: If you have taken the other two courses of this specialization, this one will be harder (mostly because of the programming assignments). However, if you make it through the first week of this course, you will make it through the full course with high probability.",Computer Science

910,Introduction to Formal Concept Analysis,Higher School of Economics,Coursera,Sergei Obiedkov,Free Online Course (Audit),Paid Certificate Available,Intermediate,"6 weeks long, 26 hours worth of material",English,English,"This online course is an introduction into formal concept analysis (FCA), a mathematical theory oriented at applications in knowledge representation, knowledge acquisition, data analysis and visualization. It provides tools for understanding the data by representing it as a hierarchy of concepts or, more exactly, a concept lattice. FCA can help in processing a wide class of data types providing a framework in which various data analysis and knowledge acquisition techniques can be formulated. In this course, we focus on some of these techniques, as well as cover the theoretical foundations and algorithmic issues of FCA.

Upon completion of the course, the students will be able to use the mathematical techniques and computational tools of formal concept analysis in their own research projects involving data processing. Among other things, the students will learn about FCA-based approaches to clustering and dependency mining.

The course is self-contained, although basic knowledge of elementary set theory, propositional logic, and probability theory would help. End-of-the-week quizzes include easy questions aimed at checking basic understanding of the topic, as well as more advanced problems that may require some effort to be solved.

This week we will learn the basic notions of formal concept analysis (FCA). We'll talk about some of its typical applications, such as conceptual clustering and search for implicational dependencies in data. We'll see a few examples of concept lattices and learn how to interpret them. The simplest data structure in formal concept analysis is the formal context. It is used to describe objects in terms of attributes they have. Derivation operators in a formal context link together object and attribute subsets; they are used to define formal concepts. They also give rise to closure operators, and we'll talk about what these are, too. We'll have a look at software called Concept Explorer, which is good for basic processing of formal contexts. We'll also talk a little bit about many-valued contexts, where attributes may have many values. Conceptual scaling is used to transform many-valued contexts into ""standard"", one-valued, formal contexts.",Computer Science

We will discuss the general approaches to financial estimation, consider the applications to credit scoring and marketing response models, and focus on the relationship between statistical model quality metrics and financial results, as well as the concepts of A/B testing and potential biases as they apply to historical data.

Multiple courses focus on building machine learning models and assessing their predictive power. However, much less attention is usually paid to explaining how the model quality translates into financial results. Even more so, decision strategies relying on model predictions are normally not covered in great detail.

In this course, we will focus on the step when we already have a ML model and want to estimate the expected financial results, and verify the model by running either an A/B test or a backtest. In addition, we will learn how to tune threshold decision rules for model probabilities, thereby improving financial results, as well as account for model uncertainty or biases in historical data that may tamper with our financial estimates. We will analyze the binary classification case, which is the most common type of a ML task.

After completing this course, you, as a data scientist, will be able to come up with better arguments when explaining the value of your machine learning models to your leadership. If your role in the company gravitates toward business processes, you will gain a better understanding of how machine learning models can have an impact on the financial results.","Project valuation: valuation metrics, planning and rules

How efficiently can you pack objects into a minimum number of boxes? How well can you cluster nodes so as to cheaply separate a network into components around a few centers? These are examples of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. It is most likely impossible to solve such problems efficiently, so our aim is to give an approximate solution that can be computed in polynomial time and that at the same time has provable guarantees on its cost relative to the optimum.

This course assumes knowledge of a standard undergraduate Algorithms course, and particularly emphasizes algorithms that can be designed using linear programming, a favorite and amazingly successful technique in this area. By taking this course, you will be exposed to a range of problems at the foundations of theoretical computer science, and to powerful design and analysis techniques. Upon completion, you will be able to recognize, when faced with a new combinatorial optimization problem, whether it is close to one of a few known basic problems, and will be able to design linear programming relaxations and use randomized rounding to attempt to solve your own problem.

These domains include agriculture, space, healthcare, manufacturing, construction, water, and mining, which are presently transitioning their legacy infrastructure to support IoT. Today it is possible to envision pervasive connectivity, storage, and computation, which, in turn, gives rise to building different IoT solutions. IoT-based applications such as innovative shopping system, infrastructure management in both urban and rural areas, remote health monitoring and emergency notification systems, and transportation systems, are gradually relying on IoT based systems. Therefore, it is very important to learn the fundamentals of this emerging technology.INTENDED AUDIENCE : CSE, IT, ECE, EE, Instrumentation Engg, Industrial EngineeringPREREQUISITES : Basic programming knowledge","Week 1: Introduction to IoT: Part I, Part II, Sensing, Actuation, Basics of Networking: Part-IWeek 2: Basics of Networking: Part-II, Part III, Part IV, Communication Protocols: Part I, Part II

This course gives an introduction to all major programming concepts, techniques, and paradigms in a unified framework. We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow. We explain the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. We present declarative dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and show how it avoids race conditions. We give a simple formal semantics for all concepts and illustrate them with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System. This course is targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.",,Computer Science

We start from the seminal concepts of statistical mechanics like entropy, free energy and the law of equilibrium that have been developed with the purpose of describing interacting systems occurring in nature. We then move to the concept of Boltzmann machines (BM) which are interacting systems cleverly engineered to solve important problems in machine learning. Finally, we move to engineered quantum systems stressing the phenomenon of quantum interference which can lead to awesome computing power.","Week 1: Boltzmann Law

If you’d like to explore how we can interact with the world in a rigorous, computational way, and would also like to start learning to program, this is the course for you!

You may have heard lots of talk about computational thinking recently, but if you ask 10 different people what it is you’ll probably get 10 different answers. Rather than trying to define computational thinking, we’ll just say it’s a problem-solving process that includes lots of different components. In this course, we’ll explore algorithms and data collection.

Most people have a better understanding of what beginning C programming means! You’ll start learning how to develop C programs in this course by writing your first C program; learning about data types, variables, and constants; and honing your C programming skills by implementing a variety of STEM computations. This course doesn't assume you have any previous programming experience, so don't worry if you've never written code before.

If that all sounds interesting to you, go ahead and jump into the course!

Caution: Beginning (assuming no prior programming knowledge) is not the same as easy (not hard to do). Learning to program IS hard to do, especially since the courses in this specialization are built from a freshman-level college course. Meeting the course challenges while you master the material will be rewarding to you, but doing that will require hard work and maybe even a few expletives along the way.

Catastrophic destruction comes in two forms: natural and man-made. For most of history the man-made variety came in the form of warfare and required the combined resources of a nation state. All that changed March 20th, 1995. On that date, members of a quasi-religious cult in Japan attacked the Tokyo subway system using Sarin gas. It was the first deployment of a weapon of mass destruction my a non-state actor. The power of destruction once reserved to nation states was now available to small groups, even individuals. The incident was a wake up call for governments around the world. Defense establishments designed to keep rogue states in check were practically useless against non-state actors. Overnight, the number of potential enemies multiplied a hundred, maybe even a thousand-fold. In response to the Tokyo Subway Attacks, the United States took measures to protect itself from WMD attack by non-state actors. Those measures were still being enacted when the nation was attacked on 9/11. On September 11, 2001, nineteen hijackers inflicted as much damage as the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941. The investigating 9/11 Commission noted the attacks for their ""surpassing disproportion"". The hijackers had achieved WMD effects without using WMD. They did this by subverting the nation's transportation infrastructure, turning passenger jets into guided missiles. Again, the security implications were profound. Non-state actors seeking to inflict domestic catastrophic destruction did not need to import, fabricate, or acquire WMD as the nation was surrounded by the means of its own destruction in the form of critical infrastructure. The vulnerability of critical infrastructure had not gone unnoticed. Again, in response to the Tokyo Subway attacks, which themselves had been an attack on Japanese infrastructure, President Clinton in 1996 commissioned a panel to investigate the threat to United States' infrastructure. The panel replied in 1997 that there was no immediate threat to US infrastructure, but they were concerned with the growing risk of cyber attack. The same cyber physical systems that fueled the explosive growth of the Internet were being incorporated into Industrial Control Systems that underpinned much of the nation's critical infrastructure. The panel noted that the knowledge and skills necessary to mount a cyber attack on the nation's infrastructure was growing. As a result of this observation, President Clinton in 1998 ordered the protection of US critical infrastructure, especially from cyber attack. Following 9/11, critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity were designated core missions in the 2002 Homeland Security Act establishing the new Department of Homeland Security. They remain core missions to this day, but many don't see the connection. The connection is this: cybersecurity is essential to critical infrastructure protection, which is essential to homeland security, which is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. I look forward to working with you in the coming lessons. Best wishes and good luck!

The drinking water and electricity infrastructures are two of fourteen subsectors comprising what are known as ""lifeline infrastructure"". The 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan identifies four lifeline infrastructure sectors: 1) water, 2) energy, 3) transportation, and 4) communications. These sectors are designated ""lifeline"" because many other infrastructures depend upon them. The drinking water subsector is part of the water sector, and the electricity subsector is part of the energy sector. Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. The NIPP employs a five-step continuous improvement program called the Risk Management Framework. NIPP implementation is overseen by DHS-designated Sector-Specific Agencies staffed by various Federal departments. The Sector-Specific Agencies work in voluntary cooperation with industry representatives to apply the Risk Management Framework and document results in corresponding Sector-Specific Plans. The program began in 2007 and the most recent Sector-Specific Plans were published in 2016. In February 2013, President Obama issued Executive 13636 directing the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a voluntary set of recommendations for strengthening infrastructure cybersecurity measures. EO13636 also asked Federal agencies with regulating authority to make a recommendation whether the NIST Cybersecurity Framework should be made mandatory. The Environmental Protection Agency who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the drinking water subsector recommended voluntary application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Department of Energy who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the electricity subsector replied that it was already implementing the Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, which indeed was what the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was based on. The Department of Energy, though, recommended voluntary application of the ES-C2M2. This module will examine both the drinking water and electricity lifeline infrastructure subsectors, and elements and application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ES-C2M2.","Module 5: Water Infrastructure & NIST Cybersecurity Framework

Last century is noted for the creation of machines which can operate other machines. Nowadays the creation of devices that interact with the physical world is available to anyone.
Our course consists of a series of practical problems on making things that work independently: they make their own decisions, act, move, communicate with each other and people around, and control other devices. We will demonstrate how to assemble such devices and programme them using the Arduino platform as a basis.
After this course, you will be able to create devices that read the data about the external world with a variety of sensors, receive and forward this data to a PC, the Internet and mobile devices, and control indexing and the movement. The creation of such devices will involve design, the study of their components, the assemblage of circuit boards, coding and diagnostics. Along with the creation of the devices themselves, you will perform visualization on a PC, create a web page that will demonstrate one of your devices, and figure out how an FDM 3D-printer is configured and how it functions.
Besides those keen on robotics or looking to broaden their horizons and develop their skills, the course will also be useful to anyone facing the task of home and industrial automation, as well as to anyone engaged in industrial design, advertising and art.
The course does not require any special knowledge from the participants and is open even to students of upper secondary school. Programming skills and the level of English allowing to read technical documentation would be an advantage, but this is not obligatory.
The entire course is dedicated to practice, so the best way for you would be to get hold of some electronics, follow the illustrated examples and experiment on your own.

The reasons of this state of affairs may be numerous, but possibly the most significant among them is that it is a relatively new scientific area, and it's clear interpretations are not yet widely spread. The main obstacle here is the word ""quantum"", which refers to quantum mechanics - one of the most counter-intuitive ways to describe our world.

But fear not! This is not a course on quantum mechanics. We will gently touch it in the beginning and then leave it apart, concentrating on the mathematical model of quantum computer, generously developed for us by physicists. This doesn't mean that the whole course is mathematics either (however there will be enough of it). We will build a simple working quantum computer with our bare hands, and we will consider some algorithms, designed for bigger quantum computers which are not yet developed.

The course material is designed for those computer scientists, engineers and programmers who believe, that there's something else than just HLL programming, that will move our computing power further into infinity.

Since the course is introductory, the only prerequisites are complex numbers and linear algebra. These two are required and they have to be enough.

Happy learning!","Intro
In this module we will discuss the nature of computations. How would you define a computation? How computations evolved? We will take a look at the computer generations and what they mean to us if we want to predict what comes next on this way.

Second and third weeks are about the mathematical model of quantum computing, and how it is justified experimentally. Some more math is required here. I introduce the notion of a linear vector space, discuss some simple differential equations and use complex numbers.

The forth week is dedicated to the mathematical language of quantum mechanics. You might need this if you want to dig deeper into subject, however I touch only the tip of the iceberg here.

A quantum computer will open before humanity the solution of many fundamental and applied problems. Scientific groups and IT giants have created prototypes of quantum computers. Today, these devices have limited power, which is not enough even to compete with classic computers. However, modern scientific advances are rapidly approaching the moment of creating a universal working prototype of a quantum computer. Such importance of the quantum computer, as well as its rapid development, allows claiming that any scientist needs to understand the principles of operation and the structure of this device.
In this course, you will explore in detail the one-way quantum computing model. This model is one of the most promising in terms of practical implementation. In addition, you will understand what continuous-variable quantum computation is and how this type of computation differs from the usual computations with qubits.

Through interviews with industry experts in this area, you will be able to analyze innovations powering the rapid spread of information technology and how they present new challenges for protecting data. For example, mobile devices increase convenience but often bypass traditional security measures. After this course, you will be able to describe how the nature of the threat evolves, as culprits employ a burgeoning set of sophisticated tools to take advantage of our growing reliance on networks for critical-data exchange.

If you want to pursue a career in the public sector, the stakes are high as well. The proliferation of hackers, inevitable human errors, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) initiatives, and the ever-broadening need to share information weigh heavily on government and education organizations, and consume substantial resources.

This course builds on the foundational concepts and skills for TensorFlow taught in the first two courses in this specialisation, and focuses on the probabilistic approach to deep learning. This is an increasingly important area of deep learning that aims to quantify the noise and uncertainty that is often present in real world datasets. This is a crucial aspect when using deep learning models in applications such as autonomous vehicles or medical diagnoses; we need the model to know what it doesn't know.

You will learn how to develop probabilistic models with TensorFlow, making particular use of the TensorFlow Probability library, which is designed to make it easy to combine probabilistic models with deep learning. As such, this course can also be viewed as an introduction to the TensorFlow Probability library.

You will learn how probability distributions can be represented and incorporated into deep learning models in TensorFlow, including Bayesian neural networks, normalising flows and variational autoencoders. You will learn how to develop models for uncertainty quantification, as well as generative models that can create new samples similar to those in the dataset, such as images of celebrity faces.

You will put concepts that you learn about into practice straight away in practical, hands-on coding tutorials, which you will be guided through by a graduate teaching assistant. In addition there is a series of automatically graded programming assignments for you to consolidate your skills.

At the end of the course, you will bring many of the concepts together in a Capstone Project, where you will develop a variational autoencoder algorithm to produce a generative model of a synthetic image dataset that you will create yourself.

This course follows on from the previous two courses in the specialisation, Getting Started with TensorFlow 2 and Customising Your Models with TensorFlow 2. The additional prerequisite knowledge required in order to be successful in this course is a solid foundation in probability and statistics. In particular, it is assumed that you are familiar with standard probability distributions, probability density functions, and concepts such as maximum likelihood estimation, change of variables formula for random variables, and the evidence lower bound (ELBO) used in variational inference.","TensorFlow Distributions
Probabilistic modelling is a powerful and principled approach that provides a framework in which to take account of uncertainty in the data. The TensorFlow Probability (TFP) library provides tools for developing probabilistic models that extend the capability of TensorFlow. In this first week of the course, you will learn how to use the Distribution objects in TFP, and the key methods to sample from and compute probabilities from these distributions. You will also learn how to make these distributions trainable. The programming assignment or this week will put these techniques into practice by implementing a Naive Bayes classifier on the Iris dataset.",Computer Science

Learn Python programming language as a creative medium for design, architecture, art and beyond. Learners will develop, analyze and critique algorithmic approaches to digital drawing, modeling, and projection. Specifically, the powerful and robust Python Rhinoscript library will be introduced and explored in detail. This library allows Rhinoceros, the popular 3D graphics and computer-aided design (CAD) modeling software to be scripted with text-based code. Scripting in this manner can automate existing processes and can lead to novel kinds of relationships, and orders of shape and form.","Session 1: Procedural Points 
Why design algorithmically? Students will understand the basics of Python syntax and organization of the Rhinoscript library. Students will be comfortable creating, running, and editing a basic script. Students will demonstrate a capacity to create, work with, and distinguish between point coordinates and point objects. Demonstrations: procedural point spiral, gradient point cloud. Session 2: 
What is the nature of a curve? Students will demonstrate multiple methods for creating and editing curves–which is the topological term for one-dimensional objects including straight line segments. The class will explore the concept of the “blip” and the capacity of a set of curves to collectively define space. Demonstrations: Interpolated curves of various degrees before and after sorting; best fit circles; curve parameters, evaluating curves, and extraction of curve points for the purse of editing curves with looping. Assignment: Double-blip connection of curves: blip within each curve and blip in the aggregation of curves. Session 3: 
What is the nature of a surface? Students will demonstrate methods for creating and editing surfaces beginning with the Rhinoscript functions that correspond with the most commonly used surface tools in Rhinoceros: loft, sweep1 and networksurface. Demonstrations: lofting and list-management, rebuilding surfaces in sequence. Assignment: conditional surface–divide a surface into patches and cull based on some geometric criteria. Session 4: 
How can a surface generate lines? How can lines represent a surface? This week's lecture begins with an important premise: a surface is a 2-D space organized in terms of 'U' and 'V' axes that can be treated similarly to 'X' and 'Y' axes in Cartesian space. This allows drawing “in” a surface, trimming a surface based on U/V domains and the evaluation of surfaces based on 2-D parameters. Demonstration: Growing lines based on surface normals; surface to surface lines. Assignment: Hatch a terrain-like surface so that its geometry is revealed completely when viewed orthographically.

How can projection serve as a creative act? Students will explore methods for geometrically constructing perspective computationally and use projective methods for the creation of new forms and shapes.

Your team needs it, your boss demands it, and your career loves it. After all, LinkedIn places it as one of the top few ""Skills Companies Need Most"" and as the very top emerging job in the U.S.

If you want to participate in the deployment of machine learning (aka predictive analytics), you've got to learn how it works. Even if you work as a business leader rather than a hands-on practitioner – even if you won't crunch the numbers yourself – you need to grasp the underlying mechanics in order to help navigate the overall project. Whether you're an executive, decision maker, or operational manager overseeing how predictive models integrate to drive decisions, the more you know, the better.

And yet, looking under the hood will delight you. The science behind machine learning intrigues and surprises, and an intuitive understanding is not hard to come by. With its impact on the world growing so quickly, it's time to demystify the predictive power of data – and how to scientifically tap it.

This course will show you how machine learning works. It covers the foundational underpinnings, the way insights are gleaned from data, how we can trust these insights are reliable, and how well predictive models perform – which can be established with pretty straightforward arithmetic. These are things every business professional needs to know, in addition to the quants.

And this course continues beyond machine learning standards to also cover cutting-edge, advanced methods, as well as preparing you to circumvent prevalent pitfalls that seldom receive the attention they deserve. The course dives deeply into these topics, and yet remains accessible to non-technical learners and newcomers.

With this course, you'll learn what works and what doesn't – the good, the bad, and the fuzzy:

– How predictive modeling algorithms work, including decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks

– Treacherous pitfalls such as overfitting, p-hacking, and presuming causation from correlations

– How to interpret a predictive model in detail and explain how it works

– Advanced methods such as ensembles and uplift modeling (aka persuasion modeling)

– How to pick a tool, selecting from the many machine learning software options

– How to evaluate a predictive model, reporting on its performance in business terms

– How to screen a predictive model for potential bias against protected classes – aka AI ethics

IN-DEPTH YET ACCESSIBLE. Brought to you by industry leader Eric Siegel – a winner of teaching awards when he was a professor at Columbia University – this curriculum stands out as one of the most thorough, engaging, and surprisingly accessible on the subject of machine learning.

NO HANDS-ON AND NO HEAVY MATH. Rather than a hands-on training, this course serves both business leaders and burgeoning data scientists alike with expansive coverage of the state-of-the-art techniques and the most pernicious pitfalls. There are no exercises involving coding or the use of machine learning software. However, for one of the assessments, you'll perform a hands-on exercise, creating a predictive model by hand in Excel or Google Sheets and visualizing how it improves before your eyes.

BUT TECHNICAL LEARNERS SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK. Before jumping straight into the hands-on, as quants are inclined to do, consider one thing: This curriculum provides complementary know-how that all great techies also need to master. It contextualizes the core technology with a strong conceptual framework and covers topics that are generally omitted from even the most technical of courses, including uplift modeling (aka persuasion modeling) and some particularly treacherous pitfalls.

VENDOR-NEUTRAL. This course includes illuminating software demos of machine learning in action using SAS products. However, the curriculum is vendor-neutral and universally-applicable. The contents and learning objectives apply, regardless of which machine learning software tools you end up choosing to work with.

PREREQUISITES. Before this course, learners should take the first two of this specialization's three courses, ""The Power of Machine Learning"" and ""Launching Machine Learning.""","MODULE 1 - The Foundational Underpinnings of Machine Learning

When put in simple terms, say you want to make the machine recognize Mr. X standing in front of Mt. E on an image;; this task is a stratified or hierarchical recognition task. At the base of the recognition pyramid would be features which can discriminate flats, lines, curves, sharp angles, color;; higher up will be kernels which use this information to discriminate body parts, trees, natural scenery, clouds, etc.;; higher up it will use this knowledge to recognize humans, animals, mountains, etc.;; and higher up it will learn to recognize Mr. X and Mt. E and finally the apex lexical synthesizer module would say that Mr. X is standing in front of Mt. E. Deep learning is all about how you make machines synthesize this hierarchical logic and also learn these representative features and kernels all by itself.

You will understand the process necessary for working with management and information owners, custodians, and users so that proper data classifications are defined. This will ensure the proper handling of all hard copy and electronic information.
The Security operations and Administration course addresses basic security concepts and the application of those concepts in the day to day operation and administration of enterprise computer systems and the information that they host.Ethical considerations in general, and the (ISC)2 Code of Ethics in particular, provide the backdrop for any discussion of information security and SSCP candidates will be tested on both. Information security professionals often find themselves in positions of trust and must be beyond reproach in every way.Several core principles of information security stand above all others and this domain covers these principles in some depth. It can be said that the CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity and availability forms the basis for almost everything that we do in information security and the SSCP candidate must not only fully understand these principles but be able to apply them in all situations. additional security concepts covered in this domain include privacy, least privilege, non-repudiation and the separation of duties.

The Computational Geometry taught in this course is derived from classical discrete/combinatorial geometry and modern computer science.
Computational Geometry first appeared on the horizon when M. I. Shamos presented his Ph.D. dissertation in 1978. Since then, this phrase has been used to refer to algorithmic study on discrete and combinatorial geometric structures and can also be regarded as the geometric version of Algorithm Design and Analysis. Computational Geometry is now considered the basis of robotics, computer aided design and manufacturing (CAM and CID), and geographic information systems (GIS).",,Computer Science

Developing better prediction models is a critical step in the pursuit of improved health care: we need these tools to guide our decision-making on preventive measures, and individualized treatments. In order to effectively use and develop these models, we must understand them better. In this course, you will learn how to make accurate prediction tools, and how to assess their validity. First, we will discuss the role of predictive analytics for prevention, diagnosis, and effectiveness. Then, we look at key concepts such as study design, sample size and overfitting.

Furthermore, we comprehensively discuss important modelling issues such as missing values, non-linear relations and model selection. The importance of the bias-variance tradeoff and its role in prediction is also addressed. Finally, we look at various way to evaluate a model - through performance measures, and by assessing both internal and external validity. We also discuss how to update a model to a specific setting.

Throughout the course, we illustrate the concepts introduced in the lectures using R. You need not install R on your computer to follow the course: you will be able to access R and all the example datasets within the Coursera environment. We do however make references to further packages that you can use for certain type of analyses – feel free to install and use them on your computer.

Furthermore, each module can also contain practice quiz questions. In these, you will pass regardless of whether you provided a right or wrong answer. You will learn the most by first thinking about the answers themselves and then checking your answers with the correct answers and explanations provided.

This course is part of a Master's program Population Health Management at Leiden University (currently in development).","Welcome to Leiden University
