This course, part of the Algorithms and Data Structures MicroMasters program, discusses inherently hard problems that you will come across in the real-world that do not have a known provably efficient algorithm, known as NP-Complete problems.
You will practice solving large instances of some of these problems despite their hardness using very efficient specialized software and algorithmic techniques including:
SAT-solvers
Approximate algorithms
Special cases of NP-hard problems
Heuristic algorithms""",

Although many of the algorithms you've learned so far are applied in practice a lot, it turns out that the world is dominated by real-world problems without a known provably efficient algorithm. Many of these problems can be reduced to one of the classical problems called NP-complete problems which either cannot be solved by a polynomial algorithm or solving any one of them would win you a million dollars (see Millenium Prize Problems) and eternal worldwide fame for solving the main problem of computer science called P vs NP. It's good to know this before trying to solve a problem before the tomorrow's deadline :) Although these problems are very unlikely to be solvable efficiently in the nearest future, people always come up with various workarounds. In this module you will study the classical NP-complete problems and the reductions between them.

It is natural to ask whether quantum technologies could boost learning algorithms: this field of inquiry is called quantum-enhanced machine learning. The goal of this course is to show what benefits current and future quantum technologies can provide to machine learning, focusing on algorithms that are challenging with classical digital computers. We put a strong emphasis on implementing the protocols, using open source frameworks in Python. Prominent researchers in the field will give guest lectures to provide extra depth to each major topic. These guest lecturers include Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Seth Lloyd, Roger Melko, and Maria Schuld.

In particular, we will address the following objectives:

1) Understand the basics of quantum states as a generalization of classical probability distributions, their evolution in closed and open systems, and measurements as a form of sampling. Describe elementary classical and quantum many-body systems.

2) Contrast quantum computing paradigms and implementations. Recognize the limitations of current and near-future quantum technologies and the kind of the tasks where they outperform or are expected to outperform classical computers. Explain variational circuits.

3) Describe and implement classical-quantum hybrid learning algorithms. Encode classical information in quantum systems.

This course gives an introduction to all major programming concepts, techniques, and paradigms in a unified framework. We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow. We explain the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. We present declarative dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and show how it avoids race conditions. We give a simple formal semantics for all concepts and illustrate them with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System. This course is targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.""",

Blockchain-based decentralized identity management is revolutionizing this space. The three Hyperledger open source projects, Aries, Indy and Ursa, provide the foundation for distributed applications built on authentic data, applications that implement the concept of “Trust over IP.” Together, the three projects provide tools, libraries, and reusable components for creating and using independent digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers that are interoperable across jurisdictions, applications and other data silos. While this course will cover what you need to know about Indy and Ursa, the main focus is Aries and how you can use it to quickly build your own applications on a solid digital foundation of trust.

With several million users and counting, Arduino gives anyone the power to innovate -  from designing a connected object for their own home to launching a prototype of a product for their own business.

This course is ideal for students in design or electronics. It's also highly applicable for engineers, designers, or developers who want to strengthen their skills in interactive electronics. It suits those who are either completely new to Arduino or want to practice their skills with concrete coding challenges.

You will learn about electronics and programming, starting from the very basics and building up to mastery of the Arduino platform. You will learn how to use sensors to detect external events, such as light or sound, and how to perform an action linked to these events.

The course also provides a natural introduction to the world of FabLabs, an international network of over a thousand spaces where people can access digital manufacturing machines and practice using Arduino alongside other makers.

The course also provides recommendations of where learners can easily purchase an arduino starter kit to get the right hardware to set themselves up or online simulators which work well as alternatives if they aren't quite ready to invest in the material yet.

Want to get creative? You’ll see that everyone can become a maker! Join us!

By leveraging the Microsoft Bot Framework, developers can create, integrate, and manage a wide variety of bots and bot experiences that interact with users naturally. The tools and services available in Microsoft Bot Framework dramatically reduce the amount of code and coordination required to develop “enterprise-ready” bot experiences.

In this practical course, you'll explore “Conversation as a Platform” as it pertains to natural language understanding, bots, and Cortana. You'll work through hands-on exercises to learn how to piece them together—and find out how to make “Conversation as a Platform” a reality in your organization.

The course starts with an overview of the Microsoft Bot Framework, and then takes a look at Azure Bot Service, which is designed to provision every resource required for production bots at the same time, as an integrated collection of services. The course material also shows how Azure Bot Service provides an integrated environment, specifically designed for developing bots.

Explore Microsoft Language Understanding (LUIS) to create language models and add natural language understanding to bot experiences. Leverage Microsoft QnA Maker to develop “question and answer” bots, ideal for online support experiences. And dig into Cortana Skills, where your bot experience can be extended to any device capable of running Cortana; including Windows 10, Android, and even iOS devices.

Uncover the latest best practices of bot design and development principles, as you learn how to create Node.js bots. These can run on any platform and numerous third-party channels, such as Skype, Microsoft Teams, Slack—even Cortana. With a prerequisite of proficiency in a C-based programming language like C, C#, C++, or Java, follow along with the instructor as you work through the labs to replicate and modify the code in the examples.

You'll wrap up the course by creating a Cortana Skills bot that leverages leading edge artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language understanding to discover related images, videos, and news for popular people, topics, and concepts.

And it’s as much about the technology choices and system architecture as it is about the data architecture and the applications.

One thing that’s clear when exploring these new roles is that no one designs in a vacuum. Experts work in teams, collaborate, and bring in specialists that go deep on specific technical areas. They talk to business owners, determine requirements, analyze existing systems, draft specifications, and more. Does this sound like you and your colleagues? Whether you’re the system architect, the application architect, the cloud architect, or another specialist or consultant, if you’re on one of these teams, this course can help train you on data architecture design at the highest planning level.

In these comprehensive sessions, start with an exploration of some of the core business problems that you need to solve when you design systems, such as cross-border data governance issues, PII regulations, GDPR, global-scale, security, and monitoring. Take a look at technology options, since these complex issues often inform your technology decisions. Learn about the patterns that can help resolve these problems, along with how to implement those patterns. As you look at the design choices you’d make in a modern cloud app from the perspective of traditional OLTP-style applications, bring these pieces together to create the systems and structures to manage the data in your solutions.

Dive into case studies in this advanced course, get hands-on with design exercises, see how business and technology problems are brought together and solved, and learn how to design data platform solutions and applications that meet critical business needs.""",

The Vision APIs available in Microsoft Cognitive Services offer many ready-to-use and easy-to-consume features that help you use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve your business problems. In this practical course, take an in-depth look at Vision APIs, work through hands-on exercises to learn how to piece them together, and find out how to put them to work in your organization.

Start with an overview of Microsoft Cognitive Services, and then take a look at the Computer Vision API, which gathers actionable information in images. Learn about optical character recognition (OCR) and image manipulation. Explore the Face API to detect, identify, analyze, organize, and tag photos and to create metadata around them. Get the details on the Emotion API, which helps personalize user experience with emotion recognition. And dig into the Custom Vision API, which enables you to customize computer vision models as required for your own specific use cases.

Leverage the latest best practices and Fluent Design principles, as you learn how to create Windows 10 Universal Windows Platform applications that can run on multiple devices, including desktops, tablets, phones, HoloLens, and Xbox consoles. With a prerequisite of proficiency in a C-based programming language like C, C#, C++, or Java, follow along with the instructor as you work through the labs to replicate and modify code in the examples.

Wrap up the course by creating an application that analyzes and tags images found in Twitter timelines for the presence of human faces and their recognized emotion, based on information returned from the Computer Vision, Face, Emotion, and Custom Vision APIs. The app can optionally even attempt to locate the source and physical location of people, places, or organizations referenced in the content. From a general overview to specific use cases and hands-on practice, this course gives you what you need to create AI apps with off-the-shelf features in Cognitive Services Vision APIs.""",

Module 2: Configure shared resources
Users need access to resources, including but not limited to files, folders, network shares, and printers. Your job, at times at least, is to let those users access what they need, and nothing more. That’s how you keep resources secure. This module covers all aspects of this, from configuring shared resources to configuring file and folder (and printer) access, and configuring authentication and authorization for both workgroups and domains.


Encryption protects data from unauthorized access when other security measures fail. Much of the time failure is the result of someone gaining physical access to a machine and having the knowledge and time to figure out how to access the data on it. There are many ways this type of breach can occur. However, with Encrypting File System (EFS), the public and private keys that are generated during encryption ensure that only the user that encrypted the file can decrypt it. Technically, encrypted data can only be decrypted if the user’s personal encryption certificate is available, which is generated using the private key. Another user can’t access this key, and neither can a person who tries to access data to copy or move it who does not have the proper credentials. In this module, we also look at BitLocker and how it helps protect computers that are lost or stolen from data theft or exposure, and offers more secure data deletion when computers are decommissioned. Data on a lost or stolen computer is vulnerable to unauthorized access, either by running a software attack tool against it, or by transferring the computer's hard disk to a different computer. BitLocker helps mitigate unauthorized data access on lost or stolen computers by combining two major data-protection procedures: encrypting the entire Windows operating system volume on the hard disk, and encrypting multiple fixed volumes""",

          "syllabus" : """Module 1: Group Policy and PowerShell, Better Together
Group Policy is a system that you can use to apply configuration settings to Windows clients and servers. You can create or enable GPOs that contain Group Policy settings, and domain-joined Windows 10–based computers download and apply the settings in GPOs. Group policy, Active Directory, and Windows PowerShell all go together. As a Windows system administrator, it is assumed you have at least some familiarity with Active Directory Domain Services, and Windows PowerShell. This module will help you take your everyday tasks to the next level.


With Windows 10 Pro and Windows 10 Enterprise, you can create virtual machines that are housed inside a single operating system on a single computer. These virtual machines can run their own operating systems, and you can separate and secure them with virtual switches. A hypervisor keeps these “child” operating systems separate from the parent operating system. Hyper-V uses the same professional-strength hypervisor found in Windows Server products. In corporate settings, administrators can use server-based virtualization tools to give users access to apps or entire desktop environments, which can be delivered to a wide range of device types. Windows desktops and apps from the datacenter or RemoteApp from the Azure cloud can run on a variety of devices. Employees install Microsoft Remote Desktop clients and run desktops and apps on their laptops, tablets or phones and stay productive on the go.


Configuring data storage requires knowledge of both old and new technology. You need to be familiar with traditional local storage using hard drives as well as cloud-based storage using services such as OneDrive for Business. You also need to consider distributed storage options such as using Distributed File System (DFS) to replicate data across WANs as well as using Storage Spaces for local data resiliency. Once you’ve decided how to store your data, you also need to consider how you can share data with others, safeguard it from theft, and protect it from unauthorized access. Windows 10 provides extensive built-in support for both local and cloud-based storage and offers the IT Pro a multitude of security-related choices for securing data while it is at rest either locally or on OneDrive for Business, or when it is mobile on a removable drive.""",

Along the way, you’ll be introduced to working with Azure cloud technologies. As you’re introduced to the different parts of the curriculum, you’ll get a feel for how Azure’s Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering is organized into compute, networking, and storage pillars. And how Platform as a Service (PaaS) service capabilities can be built on top of the infrastructure.

Understanding these pillars is going to help you in basic deployment and management operations. In addition to being able to provision compute, networking, and storage resources, you’ll learn how to scale workloads efficiently and to automate application management tasks and other important administrative functions like security, back up, replication, and migration from an on-premises environment to the cloud.

While Azure as a cloud platform is large in scope, by the end of this course, you should have a good sense of how the individual courses in the curriculum map to the platform and fit within the Azure cloud administrator role.""",

The course begins with a quick walkthrough of the cloud gateway options available today and where Azure and the Azure IoT Hub fit in. Next, you create your own IoT Hub and explore features of the IoT Hub Service. You will then learn how to configure the development environment for an MXChip device, register your device with the IoT Hub, and deploy a pre-configured solution that demonstrates how communication between a device and the cloud is implemented.

You will then take a closer look at the Azure IoT SDKs and how to implement secure 2-way communication between devices and the cloud. You will provision a Raspberry Pi device and walk your way through the process of developing a solution as you dig deeper into the code that leverages the SDKs to implement secure communication with the hub. You will also learn how to provision simulated devices using client tools such as Azure CLI and how to preform management tasks while examining aspects of device security.

Next, you will learn about the Device Provisioning Service and how to provision devices at scale. You will also use automated processes to configure device identities and properties at scale. After that, you will examine device management tasks using both device twins and direct methods, and learn why using device twins is the recommended approach. Shifting focus briefly to managing IoT Hub operations, you will learn more about IoT Hub endpoints and message routing.

To finish up this course, you will be tasked with implementing a real-world project scenario. You will evaluate project documentation to determine requirements, develop your project hardware and software, and then apply what you learned during the course to implement the client-side and server-side portions of the solution.

This course provides the expert guidance and hands-on experience that you need in order to prepare for a successful IoT solution roll-out.

Module 1 provides an overview of the IoT Reference Architecture, introducing Things, Insights and Actions. With a basic understanding of the architecture, students will examine the core and optional subsystems, cross-cutting concerns, principles and concepts of the Reference Architecture, and architecture of key subsystems.

Module 2 uses the Remote Monitoring Solution Accelerator to explore the receipt and processing of remote device telemetry (the most common scenario for IoT) within the context of the Reference Architecture. Students will identify the areas of alignment and where the solution departs from the reference, as well as the tools used to deploy the solution. Students then review some options for customizing the Remote Monitoring solution and complete some customization activities. Students will also review additional accelerator solutions and learn when they may be applicable.

Module 3 introduces students to approaches that can be used to determine and document the business and system requirements that drive key factors such as security, scalability, availability, and disaster recovery service level agreements. They will then apply the requirements, develop a candidate architecture, build a PoC, deliver a cost analysis, and evaluate against quality measures. To finish up the module, students will propose the IoT Hub Operations, Monitoring and Security Processes and Procedures to support the candidate architecture.

In Module 4 students take their defined business requirements and examine how to apply their understanding of IoT Architecture and the capabilities of Azure IoT to create a compelling proposal. They will learn the key attributes of the Azure Cloud and the Azure IoT architecture that should be emphasized, approaches for developing the cost of a proposal and other factors such as support.

Have you considered that there needs to be a developer behind the scenes for every one of those devices? If you’re ready to change the world by converting the envisioned gadgets of tomorrow into digital reality, join this course and take your first steps toward programming for the Internet of Things.

Learn the basics of embedded device programming by implementing various projects on Raspberry Pi and MXChip AZ3166 devices (the AZ3166 is Arduino-software compatible). Learn how to write the software that controls the hardware (temperature sensors, photo cells, and more), and get started making a difference with procedural programming.

Begin with an intro to embedded programming, exploring embedded device types and the inputs and outputs for devices and sensors. Then work your way through a series of hands-on lab projects that teach you how to develop the hardware/software interface, help you to understand C programming for embedded devices, and explore basic data management for a resource-constrained device. From there, dive into embedded solutions that use your own circuit designs to solve real-world problems.

After completing this course, students will be able to develop embedded device systems that capture and process data from analog and digital sensors commonly found in IoT solutions.

The lab project work in this course is based on the hardware found in the Microsoft IoT Pack for Raspberry Pi and the MXChip IoT DevKit.You may want to purchase in advance of starting the course.""",
